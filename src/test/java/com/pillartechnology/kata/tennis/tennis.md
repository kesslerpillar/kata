===========

This Kata is about implementing a simple tennis game. 

- To win
    - Score at least four points
    - Get two points more than opponent

- The running scores are called
    - 0pts = "Love"
    - 1pt = "Fifteen",
    - 2pts = "Thirty"
    - 3pts = "Forty"
- If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "Deuce"
- If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "Advantage" for the player in the lead. E.g. “Advantage player1”

Sample Scores

- new game = 'Love all'
- player one scores = 'Fifteen, Love'
- both players score 3 time = 'Deuce'
- player one scores 4 times and player two scores once = '<Player 1's Name> wins'
- player one scores 4 times and player two scores 5 time = 'Advantage <Player 2's Name>'
